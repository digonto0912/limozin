# Firebase Domain Authorization Fix

## 🚨 The Root Problem

The issue you're experiencing is because Firebase Authentication is not authorized to work with your Vercel domain. Here's what's happening:

1. **Firebase Auth Handler**: When you click "Sign in with Google", Firebase redirects to `https://limozin-85645.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`
2. **Domain Not Authorized**: Your actual domain (Vercel deployment) is not in Firebase's authorized domains list
3. **Init.json 404**: Firebase tries to load configuration from Firebase Hosting, but you're on Vercel

## 🔧 How to Fix This

### Step 1: Add Your Domain to Firebase Console

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. **Select your project**: `limozin-85645`
3. **Go to Authentication**: Click "Authentication" in the left sidebar
4. **Go to Settings**: Click the "Settings" tab
5. **Find "Authorized domains"**: Scroll down to the "Authorized domains" section
6. **Add your domains**: Click "Add domain" and add:
   - Your Vercel deployment domain (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`)
   - Any custom domains you use
   - `localhost` (for development)

### Step 2: Get Your Current Deployment URL

Run this command to see your current Vercel deployment:

```bash
vercel ls
```

Or check in your Vercel dashboard for the deployment URL.

### Step 3: Test the Fix

After adding your domain to Firebase Console:

1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for the changes to propagate
2. **Clear your browser cache**
3. **Try authentication again**

## 🔍 Debugging Information

If it still doesn't work, check the browser console for these messages:

- ✅ `Firebase initialized successfully with project: limozin-85645`
- ✅ `Domain Configuration: { currentDomain: "your-domain", authDomain: "limozin-85645.firebaseapp.com" }`
- ❌ `auth/unauthorized-domain` error means domain not added to Firebase Console

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Click "Sign in with Google"** → Opens Google authentication popup
2. **Select Google account** → Returns to your app
3. **Automatic redirect** → Takes you to home page
4. **No 404 errors** → No more init.json requests

## 🚀 Alternative: Use Firebase Hosting (Optional)

If you prefer, you can deploy to Firebase Hosting instead of Vercel:

1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Initialize Firebase: `firebase init hosting`
3. Build your app: `npm run build`
4. Deploy: `firebase deploy`

This would eliminate domain authorization issues entirely.
